# Weather App Rebuild

**Name**: Michael Heckerman

**Date**: 3/31/24

**Notes**: I have used the extra time given with the extension to work on my weather rebuild. I am hitting a brick wall with my API calls and getting it to display data. I have tried moving the key to differnt files and have made it unhidden, I get data to show when I use the fetch in postman but as soon as its in my code it just seems to not work. I need an extra set of eyes to look it over as I'm at a loss right now. I will get a peer review knowing that at this time my site is not working. I will get help identifying what is holding it up once we are not on a holiday.
